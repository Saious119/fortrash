            <p>Just as the <a href="../index.html">Home Page</a> said, I'm Andy Mahoney. I'm a Junior at Clarkson University majoring in Computer Science.
            I'm from Queensbury New York and went to highschool at Queensbury High School. My main areas of interest are system development, compilers, language theory, and Quantum computers.
            I also dabble a little bit in Robotics. </p>

                So you must be asking yourself "Why is his site named 'fortrash.com'?" Well there's a story to that. One of my favorite programming languages is Fortran, specifically Fortran 77.
                I know, very outdated, but its fun. While I was looking at domain names a friend and I were debating pros and cons of different languages, I mentioned Fortran 77 jokingly and he said "Fortran? more like Fortrash!".
                It was then I knew what my websites name must be.
