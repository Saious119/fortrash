            <p>Just as the <a href="../index.html">Home Page</a> said, I'm Andy Mahoney. I'm Graduate of Clarkson University who majored in Computer Science with a minor in Political Science. I graduated in May of 2021.
            I'm from Queensbury New York and went to highschool at Queensbury High School. My main areas of interest are system development, compilers, language theory, and especially Game Development and Game Engine design.
            I also dabble a little bit in Robotics and DevOps. At Clarkson University I became the Lab Director of the student run research lab COSI (Clarkson Open Source Institute) under Professor Jeanna Mathews. 
            I was also the President of Alpha Phi Omega, the Co-ed national service fraternity for two terms, and I was also co-founder and President for The Clarkson University Tea Club.</p>

                So you must be asking yourself "Why is his site named 'fortrash.com'?" Well there's a story to that. One of my favorite programming languages is Fortran, specifically Fortran 77.
                I know, very outdated, but its fun. While I was looking at domain names a friend and I were debating pros and cons of different languages, I mentioned Fortran 77 jokingly and he said "Fortran? more like Fortrash!".
                It was then I knew what my website's name must be.
